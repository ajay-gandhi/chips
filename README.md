> Use your computer while eating chips

Chips is a voice activated platform that allows you to:

* Send iMessages
* Send Facebook messages
* Google things
* Play music

Just download a [release](http://github.com/ajay-gandhi/chips/releases) to get
started!

## More Information

Chips lives in your menu bar. That means you can close all the windows and won't
have an annoying app icon in your dock, but Chips still runs!

Here's a complete list of the possible commands:

### Messaging

Say `[message]` to `[name]` using Facebook or iMessage.

* "imessage [name] [message]"
* "facebook [name] [message]"

### Googling

* "google [thing]"

### Play Music

* "play [album, artist, etc]"
* "start" (same as above)
* "pause"
* "shuffle"
* "repeat"
* "next"
* "previous"
* "jump [time]"
* "forward"
* "rewind"

### Be Nice!

* "hello" -> replies "hi"
* "thank you" -> replies "no problem"

## Extending Chips

You can write your own modules too! Take a look at the included modules in
`modules/` to get started!
